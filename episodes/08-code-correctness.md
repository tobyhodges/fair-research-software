::: questions

-   How can we verify that our code is correct?
-   How can we automate our software tests?
-   What makes a "good" test?
-   Which parts of our code should we prioritize for testing?

:::

::: objectives

After completing this episode, participants should be able to:

-   Explain why code testing is important and how this supports FAIR
    software.
-   Describe the different types of software tests (unit tests,
    integration tests, regression tests).
-   Implement unit tests to verify that function(s) behave as expected
    using the Python testing framework `pytest`.
-   Interpret the output from `pytest` to identify which function(s) are
    not behaving as expected.
-   Write tests using typical values, edge cases and invalid inputs to
    ensure that the code can handle extreme values and invalid inputs
    appropriately.
-   Evaluate code coverage to identify how much of the codebase is being
    tested and identify areas that need further tests.

:::

Now that we have improved the structure and readability of our code - it is much easier to 
test its functionality and improve it further. 
The goal of software testing is to check that the actual results
produced by a piece of code meet our expectations, i.e. are correct.

## Why use software testing?

Adopting software testing as part of our research workflow helps us to
conduct **better research** and produce **FAIR software**:

- Software testing can help us be more productive as it helps us to identify and fix problems with our code early and
quickly and allows us to demonstrate to ourselves and others that our
code does what we claim. More importantly, we can share our tests
alongside our code, allowing others to verify our software for themselves.
- The act of writing tests encourages to structure our code as individual functions and often results in a more
  **readable**, modular and maintainable codebase that is easier to extend or repurpose.
- Software testing improves the **accessibility** and **reusability** of our code - well-written software tests 
capture the expected behaviour of our code and can be used alongside documentation to help other developers
quickly make sense of our code. In addition, a well tested codebase allows developers to experiment with new
features safe in the knowledge that tests will reveal if their changes have broken any existing functionality.
- Software testing underpins the FAIR process by giving us the
confidence to engage in open research practices - if we are not sure that our code works as intended and produces accurate
results, we are unlikely to feel confident about sharing our code with
others. Software testing brings piece of mind by providing a
step-by-step approach that we can apply to verify that our code is
correct.

Before we move on with further code modifications, make sure your virtual development environment is active.

::: callout

### Activate your virtual environment
If it is not already active, make sure to activate your virtual environment from the root of your project directory
in your command line terminal (e.g. Bash or GitBash):

```bash
$ source venv_spacewalks/bin/activate # Mac or Linux
$ source venv_spacewalks/Scripts/activate # Windows
(venv_spacewalks) $
```

## Types of software tests

There are many different types of software testing.

-   **Unit tests** focus on testing individual functions in
    isolation. They ensure that each small part of the software performs
    as intended. By verifying the correctness of these individual units,
    we can catch errors early in the development process.

-   **Integration tests** check how different parts
    of the code e.g. functions work together.

-   **Regression tests** are used to ensure that new
    changes or updates to the codebase do not adversely affect the
    existing functionality. They involve checking whether a program or
    part of a program still generates the same results after changes
    have been made.

-   **End-to-end** tests are a special type of integration testing which
    checks that a program as a whole behaves as expected.

In this course, our primary focus will be on unit testing. However, the
concepts and techniques we cover will provide a solid foundation
applicable to other types of testing.

## Informal testing

**How should we test our code?** Let’s start by considering the
following scenario. A collaborator on our project has sent us the
following code to add a `crew_size` variable to our data frame - a
column which captures the number of astronauts participating in a given
spacewalk. How do we know that it works as intended?

``` python
import re
import pandas

def calculate_crew_size(crew):
    """
    Calculate crew_size for a single crew entry

    Args:
        crew (str): The text entry in the crew column

    Returns:
        int: The crew size
    """
    if crew.split() == []:
        return None
    else:
        return len(re.split(r';', crew))-1


def add_crew_size_variable(df_):
    """
    Add crew size (crew_size) variable to the dataset

    Args:
        df_ (pd.DataFrame): The input data frame.

    Returns:
        df_copy (pd.DataFrame): A copy of df_ with the new crew_size variable added
    """
    print('Adding crew size variable (crew_size) to dataset')
    df_copy = df_.copy()
    df_copy["crew_size"] = df_copy["crew"].apply(
        calculate_crew_size
    )
    return df_copy
    
```

One approach is to copy/paste the function(s) into a python interpreter
and check that they behave as expected with some input values where we
know what the correct return value should be.

Since `add_crew_size_variable` contains boiler plate code for deriving
one column from another let's start with `calculate_crew_size`:

``` python
calculate_crew_size("Valentina Tereshkova;")
calculate_crew_size("Judith Resnik; Sally Ride;")
```

``` output
1
2
```

We can then explore the behaviour of `add_crew_size_variable` by
creating a toy data frame:

``` python
# Create a toy DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'crew': ['Anna Lee Fisher;', 'Marsha Ivins; Helen Sharman;']
})

add_crew_size_variable(data)
```

``` output
Adding crew size variable (crew_size) to dataset
                           crew  crew_size
0              Anna Lee Fisher;          1
1  Marsha Ivins; Helen Sharman;          2
```

Although this is an important process to go through as we draft our code
for the first time, there are some serious drawbacks to this approach if
used as our only form of testing.

::: discussion
## What are the limitations of informally testing code? (5 minutes)

Think about the questions below. Your instructors may ask you to share
your answers in a shared notes document and/or discuss them with other
participants.

-   Why might we choose to test our code informally?
-   What are the limitations of relying solely on informal tests to
    verify that a piece of code is behaving as expected?
:::

::: spoiler
## Discussion Spoilers

It can be tempting to test our code informally because this approach:

-   is quick and easy
-   provides immediate feedback

However, there are limitations to this approach:

-   Working interactively is error prone
-   We must repeat our tests every time we update our code; this is time
    consuming
-   We must rely on memory to keep track of how we have tested our code
    e.g. what input values we tried
-   We must rely on memory to keep track of which functions have been
    tested and which have not
:::

## Formal testing

We can overcome some of these limitations by formalising our testing
process. A formal approach to testing our function(s) is to write
dedicated test functions to check our code. These test functions:

-   Run the function we want to test - the target function with known
    inputs
-   Compare the output to known, valid results
-   Raises an error if the function’s actual output does not match the
    expected output
-   Are recorded in a test script that can be re-run on demand.

Let’s explore this process by writing some formal tests for our
`text_to_duration` function. (We'll come back to our colleague's
calculate_crew_size function later).

The `text_to_duration` function converts a duration stored as a string
(HH:MM) to a duration in hours e.g. duration "1.15" should return a
value of 1.25.

``` python
def text_to_duration(duration):
    """
    Convert a text format duration "HH:MM" to duration in hours

    Args:
        duration (str): The text format duration

    Returns:
        float: The duration in hours
    """
    hours, minutes = duration.split(":")
    duration_hours = int(hours) + int(minutes)/60
    return duration_hours
```

Let's create a new python file `test_code.py` in the root of our project
folder to store our tests.

``` bash
cd Spacewalks
touch test_code.py
```

First, we import text_to_duration into our test script. Then, we then
add our first test function:

``` python

from eva_data_analysis import text_to_duration

def test_text_to_duration_integer():
    input_value = "10:00"
    test_result = text_to_duration("10:00") == 10
    print(f"text_to_duration('10:00') == 10? {test_result}")

test_text_to_duration()
```

This test checks that when we apply text_to_duration to input value
"10:00", the output matches the expected value of 10.

In this example, we use a print statement to report whether the actual
output from text_to_duration meets our expectations.

However, this does not meet our requirement to “Raise an error if the
function’s output does not match the expected output” and means that we
must carefully read our test function’s output to identify whether it
has failed.

To ensure that our code raises an error if the function’s output does
not match the expected output, we can use an assert statement.

The assert statement in Python checks whether a condition is True or
False. If the statement is True, then assert does not return a value but
if the statement is false, then assert raises an AssertError.

Let's rewrite our test with an assert statement:

``` python

from eva_data_analysis import text_to_duration

def test_text_to_duration_integer():
    assert text_to_duration("10:00") == 10

test_text_to_duration_integer()
```

Notice that when we run test_text_to_duration_integer(), nothing
happens - there is no output. That is because our function is working
correctly and returning the expected value of 10.

Let’s see what happens when we deliberately introduce a bug into
`text_to_duration`: In the Spacewalks data analysis script let's change
`int(hours)` to `int(hour)/60` and `int(minutes)/60` to `int(minutes)`to
mimic a simple mistake in our code where the wrong element is divided by
60.

``` python
def text_to_duration(duration):
    """
    Convert a text format duration "HH:MM" to duration in hours

    Args:
        duration (str): The text format duration

    Returns:
        duration (float): The duration in hours
    """
    hours, minutes = duration.split(":")
    duration_hours = int(hours)/60 + int(minutes) # Divide the wrong element by 60
    return duration_hours
```

Notice that this time, our test fails noisily. Our assert statement has
raised an `AssertionError` - a clear signal that there is a problem in
our code that we need to fix.

``` python
test_text_to_duration_integer()
```

``` error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/AnnResearchers/Desktop/Spacewalks/test_code.py", line 7, in <module>
    test_text_to_duration_integer()
  File "/Users/AnnResearchers/Desktop/Spacewalks/test_code.py", line 5, in test_text_to_duration_integer
    assert text_to_duration("10:00") == 10
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```

What happens if we add another test to our test script? This time we'll
check that our function can handle durations with a non-zero minute
component. Notice that this time our expected value is a floating-point
number. Importantly, we cannot use a simple double equals sign (`==`) to
compare the equality of floating-point numbers. Floating-point
arithmetic can introduce very small differences due to how computers
represent these numbers internally - as a result, we check that our
floating point numbers are equal within a very small tolerance (1e-5).

``` python
from eva_data_analysis import text_to_duration

def test_text_to_duration_integer():
    assert text_to_duration("10:00") == 10
    
def test_text_to_duration_float():
    assert abs(text_to_duration("10:20") - 10.33333333) < 1e-5

test_text_to_duration_integer()
test_text_to_duration_float()
```

``` output
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/AnnResearcher/Desktop/Spacewalks/test_code.py", line 9, in <module>
    test_text_to_duration_integer()
  File "/Users/AnnResearcher/Desktop/Spacewalks/test_code.py", line 4, in test_text_to_duration_integer
    assert text_to_duration("10:00") == 10
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```

What happens when we run our updated test script? Our script stops after
the first test failure and the second test is not run. To run our
remaining tests we would have to manually comment out our failing test
and re-run the test script. As our code base and tests grow, this will
become cumbersome. This is not ideal and can be overcome by automating
our tests using a testing framework.

## Using a testing framework

Our approach so far has had two major limitations:

-   We had to carefully examine the output of our test script to work
    out if our test failed.
-   Our test script only ran our tests up to the first test failure.

We can do better than this! Testing frameworks can automatically find
all the tests in our code base, run all of them and present the test
results as a readable summary.

We will use the python testing framework pytest with its code coverage
plugin pytest-cov. To install these libraries, open a terminal and type:

``` bash
python -m pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

Let’s make sure that our tests are ready to work with pytest.

-   pytest automatically discovers tests based on specific naming
    patterns. pytest looks for files that start with `test_` or end with
    `_test.py`. Then, within these files, pytest looks for functions
    that start with test\_.\
    Our test file already meets these requirements, so there is nothing
    to do here. However, our script does contain lines to run each of
    our test functions. These are no-longer required as pytest will run
    our tests so we will remove them:

    ``` python
    # Delete
    test_text_to_duration_integer()
    test_text_to_duration_float()
    ```

-   It is also conventional when working with a testing framework to
    place test files in a tests directory at the root of our project and
    to name each test file after the code file that it targets. This
    helps in maintaining a clean structure and makes it easier for
    others to understand where the tests are located.

A set of tests for a given piece of code is called a test suite. Our
test suite is currently located in the root folder of our project. Let’s
move it to a dedicated test folder and rename our test_code.py file to
test_eva_analysis.py.

``` bash
mkdir tests
mv test_code.py tests/test_eva_analysis.py
```

Before we re-run our tests using pytest, let's update our second test.
to use pytest's `approx` function which is specifically intended for
comparing floating point numbers within a tolerance.

``` python
import pytest
from eva_data_analysis import text_to_duration

def test_text_to_duration_integer():
    assert text_to_duration("10:00") == 10
    
def test_text_to_duration_float():
    assert text_to_duration("10:20") == pytest.approx(10.33333333)
```

Let's also add some inline comments to clarify what each test is doing
and expand our syntax to highlight the logic behind our approach:

``` python
import pytest
from eva_data_analysis import text_to_duration

def test_text_to_duration_integer():
    """
    Test that text_to_duration returns expected ground truth values
    for typical whole hour durations 
    """
    actual_result =  text_to_duration("10:00")
    expected_result = 10
    assert actual_result == expected_result
    
def test_text_to_duration_float():
    """
    Test that text_to_duration returns expected ground truth values
    for typical durations with a non-zero minute component
    """
    actual_result = text_to_duration("10:20") 
    expected_result = 10.33333333
    assert actual_result == pytest.approx(expected_result)
```

Writing our tests this way highlights the key idea that each test should
compare the actual results returned by our function with expected
values.

Similarly, writing inline comments for our tests that complete the
sentence "Test that ..." helps us to understand what each test is doing
and why it is needed.

Finally, let's also modify our bug to something that will affect
durations with a non-zero minute component like "10:20" but not those
that are whole hours e.g. "10:00".

Let's change `int(hours)/60 + int(minutes)` to
`int(hours) + int(minutes)/6` a simple typo.

``` python
def text_to_duration(duration):
    """
    Convert a text format duration "HH:MM" to duration in hours

    Args:
        duration (str): The text format duration

    Returns:
        duration (float): The duration in hours
    """
    hours, minutes = duration.split(":")
    duration_hours = int(hours) + int(minutes)/6 # Divide by 6 instead of 60
    return duration_hours
```

Finally, let's run our tests:

``` bash
python -m pytest 
```

    value and the test assertion evaluates to `False`.

## Test Suite Design

Now that we have tooling in place to automatically run our test suite.
What makes a good test suite?

### Good Tests

We should aim to test that our function behaves as expected with the
full range of inputs that it might encounter. It is helpful to consider
each argument of a function in turn and identify the range of typical
values it can take. Once we have identified this typical range or ranges
(where a function takes more than one argument), we should:

-   Test at least one interior point
-   Test all values at the edge of the range
-   Test invalid values

Let's revisit the `crew_size` functions from our colleague's codebase.
First let's add the the additional functions to `eva_data_analysis.py`:

``` python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys
import re

...

def calculate_crew_size(crew):
    """
    Calculate crew_size for a single crew entry

    Args:
        crew (str): The text entry in the crew column

    Returns:
        int: The crew size
    """
    if crew.split() == []:
        return None

### Parameterising Tests

If we revisit our test suite, we can see that some of our tests do not
follow the [“Don't Repeat Yourself principle”][dry-principle] which
prevents software - including testing code - from becoming overly long
and confusing. For example, if we examine our test for
`calculate_crew_size`, we can see that a small block of code is repeated
twice with different input values:

``` python
def test_calculate_crew_size():
    """
    Test that calculate_crew_size returns expected ground truth values
    for typical crew values
    """
    actual_result = calculate_crew_size("Valentina Tereshkova;")
    expected_result = 1
    assert actual_result == expected_result

    actual_result = calculate_crew_size("Judith Resnik; Sally Ride;")
    expected_result = 2
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

Where the repeated code block is:

``` python
actual_result = calculate_crew_size(input_value)
expected_result = expected_value
assert actual_result == expected_result
```

To avoid repeating ourselves, we can use an approach called test
parameterisation. This allows us to apply our test function to a list of
input / expected output pairs without the need for repetition. To
parameterise the `calculate_crew_size` test, we rewrite the test
function as follows:

``` python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_value, expected_result", [
    ("Valentina Tereshkova;", 1),
    ("Judith Resnik; Sally Ride;", 2),
])
def test_calculate_crew_size(input_value, expected_result):
    """
    Test that calculate_crew_size returns expected ground truth values
    for typical crew values
    """
    actual_result = calculate_crew_size(input_value)
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

Notice the following key changes to our code:

-   Our unparameterised test function did not have any arguments
    (`test_calculate_crew_size()`) and our input / expected values were
    all defined the body of our test function.

-   In the parameterised version, the body of our test function has been
    rewritten as a parameterised block of code that uses the variables
    `input_value` and `expected_result` which are now arguments of the
    test function.

-   A python decorator @pytest.mark.parametrize is placed immediately
    before the test function and indicates that it should be run once for
    each set of parameters provided.

In Python, a decorator is a function that can modify the behaviour of
another function. @pytest.mark.parametrize is a decorator provided by
pytest that modifies the behaviour of our test function by running it
multiple times - once for each set of inputs. This decorator takes two
main arguments:

-   Parameter Names: A string with the names of the parameters that the
    test function will accept, separated by commas – in this case
    “input_value” and “expected_value”

-   Parameter Values: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the
    values for the parameters specified in the first argument.

The final parameterised version of our test, is more manageable,
readable and easier to maintain!
:::

### Enough Tests

In this episode, so far we've (only) written tests for two individual
functions `text_to_duration` and `calculate_crew_size`.

We can quantify the proportion of our code base that is run (also
referred to as "exercised") by a given test suite using a metric called
code coverage:

$$ \text{Line Coverage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Executed Lines}}{\text{Total Number of Executable Lines}} \right) \times 100 $$

We can calculate our test coverage using the pytest-cov library. Before
we do so, let's fix our bug so that our output is cleaner and we can
focus on the code coverage information.

``` python
def text_to_duration(duration):
    """
    Convert a text format duration "HH:MM" to duration in hours

    Args:
        duration (str): The text format duration

    Returns:
        duration (float): The duration in hours
    """
    hours, minutes = duration.split(":")
    duration_hours = int(hours) + int(minutes)/60 # Bug-free line
    return duration_hours
```

``` bash
python -m pytest --cov 
```

```

To get an in-depth report about which parts of our code are tested and
which are not, we can add the option `--cov-report=html`.

``` bash
python -m pytest --cov --cov-report=html 
```

This option generates a folder `htmlcov` which contains a html code
coverage report. This provides structured information about our test
coverage including (a) a table showing the proportion of lines in each
function that are currently tested (b) an annotated copy of our code
where untested lines are highlighted in red.

Ideally, all the lines of code in our code base should be exercised by
at least one test. However, if we lack the time and resources to test
every line of our code we should:

-   Avoid testing Python's built-in functions or functions imported from
    well-known and well-test libraries like Pandas or numpy.
-   Focus on the the parts of our code that carry the greatest
    "reputational risk" i.e. that could affect the accuracy of our
    reported results.

One the other hand, it is also important to realise that althought
coverage of less than 100% indicates that more testing may be helpful,
test coverage of 100% does not mean that our code is bug-free!

::: challenge
## Evaluating Code Coverage

Generate a code coverage report for the `Spacewalks` test suite and
extract the following information:

a.  What proportion of the code base is currently NOT exercised by the
    test suite?
b.  Which functions in our code base are currently untested?

::: solution
``` bash
python -m pytest --cov --cov-report=html
```

a.  The proportion of the code base NOT covered by our tests is
    `100 - 32%` = 68%
b.  The following functions in our code base are currently untested:
    -   read_json_to_dataframe
    -   write_dataframe_to_csv
    -   add_duration_hours_variable
    -   plot_cumulative_time_in_space
    -   add_crew_size_variable

### Implementing a minimal test suite

A member of our research team shares the following code with us to add
to the Spacewalks codebase:

``` python
def summarise_categorical(df_, varname_):
    """
    Tabulate the distribution of a categorical variable

    Args:
        df_ (pd.DataFrame): The input dataframe.
        varname_ (str): The name of the variable

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: dataframe containing the count and percentage of
        each unique value of varname_
        
    Examples:
        >>> df_example  = pd.DataFrame({
            'vehicle': ['Apollo 16', 'Apollo 17', 'Apollo 17'],
            }, index=[0, 1, 2)
        >>> summarise_categorical(df_example, "vehicle")
        Tabulating distribution of categorical variable vehicle
             vehicle  count  percentage
        0  Apollo 16      1        33.0
        1  Apollo 17      2        67.0
    """
    print(f'Tabulating distribution of categorical variable {varname_}')

    # Prepare statistical summary
    count_variable = df_[[varname_]].copy()
    count_summary = count_variable.value_counts()
    percentage_summary = round(count_summary / count_variable.size, 2) * 100

    # Combine results into a summary data frame
    df_summary = pd.concat([count_summary, percentage_summary], axis=1)
    df_summary.columns = ['count', 'percentage']
    df_summary.sort_index(inplace=True)


    df_summary = df_summary.reset_index()
    return df_summary
```

This looks like a useful tool for creating summary statistics tables, so
let's integrate this into our `eva_data_analysis.py`code and then write
a minimal test suite to check that this code is behaving as expected.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys
import re


...

def add_crew_size_variable(df_):
    """
    Add crew size (crew_size) variable to the dataset

    Args:
        df_ (pd.DataFrame): The input dataframe.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A copy of df_ with the new crew_size variable added
    """
    print('Adding crew size variable (crew_size) to dataset')
    df_copy = df_.copy()
    df_copy["crew_size"] = df_copy["crew"].apply(
        calculate_crew_size
    )
    return df_copy


def summarise_categorical(df_, varname_):
    """
    Tabulate the distribution of a categorical variable

    Args:
        df_ (pd.DataFrame): The input dataframe.
        varname_ (str): The name of the variable

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: dataframe containing the count and percentage of
        each unique value of varname_
    """
    print(f'Tabulating distribution of categorical variable {varname_}')

    # Prepare statistical summary
    count_variable = df_[[varname_]].copy()
    count_summary = count_variable.value_counts() # There is a bug here that we will fix later!
    percentage_summary = round(count_summary / count_variable.size, 2) * 100

    # Combine results into a summary data frame
    df_summary = pd.concat([count_summary, percentage_summary], axis=1)
    df_summary.columns = ['count', 'percentage']
    df_summary.sort_index(inplace=True)


    df_summary = df_summary.reset_index()
    return df_summary


if __name__ == '__main__':

    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        input_file = './eva-data.json'
        output_file = './eva-data.csv'
        print(f'Using default input and output filenames')
    else:
        input_file = sys.argv[1]
        output_file = sys.argv[2]
        print('Using custom input and output filenames')

    graph_file = './cumulative_eva_graph.png'

    eva_data = read_json_to_dataframe(input_file)

    eva_data_prepared = add_crew_size_variable(eva_data)

    write_dataframe_to_csv(eva_data_prepared, output_file)

    table_crew_size = summarise_categorical(eva_data_prepared, "crew_size")

    write_dataframe_to_csv(table_crew_size, "./table_crew_size.csv")

    plot_cumulative_time_in_space(eva_data_prepared, graph_file)

    print("--END--")
```

To write tests for this function, we'll need to be able to compare
dataframes. The pandas.testing module in the pandas library provides
functions and utilities for testing pandas objects and includes a
function `assert_frame_equal` that we can use to compare two dataframes.

::: challenge
### Exercise 1 - Typical Inputs

First, check that the function behaves as expected with typical input
values. Fill in the gaps in the skeleton test below:

``` python
import pandas.testing as pdt

def test_summarise_categorical_typical():
    """
    Test that summarise_categorical correctly tabulates
    distribution of values (counts, percentages) for a ground truth
    example (typical values)
    """
    test_input = pd.DataFrame({
        'country': _________________________________________, # FIX-ME
    }, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

    expected_result = pd.DataFrame({
        'country': ["Russia", "USA"],
        'count': [2, 3],
        'percentage': [40.0, 60.0],
    }, index=[0, 1])

    actual_result = ____________________________________________ # FIX-ME 
    
    pdt.__________________(actual_result, _______________) #FIX-ME
```

::: solution
``` python
import pandas.testing as pdt

def test_summarise_categorical():
    """
    Test that summarise_categorical correctly tabulates
    distribution of values (counts, percentages) for a simple ground truth
    example
    """
    test_input = pd.DataFrame({
        'country': ['USA', 'USA', 'USA', "Russia", "Russia"],
    }, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

    expected_result = pd.DataFrame({
        'country': ["Russia", "USA"],
        'count': [2, 3],
        'percentage': [40.0, 60.0],
    }, index=[0, 1])

    actual_result = summarise_categorical(test_input, "country")

    pdt.assert_frame_equal(actual_result, expected_result)
```
:::
:::

::: challenge
### Exercise 2 - Edge Cases

Now let's check that the function behaves as expected with edge cases.\
Does the code behave as expected when the column of interest contains
one or more missing values (pd.NA)? (write a new test).

Fill in the gaps in the skeleton test below:

``` python
import pandas.testing as pdt

def test_summarise_categorical_missvals():
    """
    Test that summarise_categorical correctly tabulates
    distribution of values (counts, percentages) for a ground truth
    example (edge case where all column contains missing values)

    test_input = _______________
    _______________
    _______________ # FIX-ME
    
    expected_result = _______________
    _______________
    _______________ # FIX-ME
    
    actual_result = summarise_categorical(test_input, "country")

    pdt.assert_frame_equal(actual_result, expected_result)
```

::: solution
``` python
import pandas.testing as pdt

def test_summarise_categorical_missvals():
    """
    Test that summarise_categorical correctly tabulates
    distribution of values (counts, percentages) for a ground truth
    example (edge case where column contains missing values)
    """
    test_input = pd.DataFrame({
        'country': ['USA', 'USA', 'USA', "Russia", pd.NA],
    }, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

    expected_result = pd.DataFrame({
        'country': ["Russia", "USA", np.nan], # np.nan because pd.NA is cast to np.nan
        'count': [1, 3, 1],
        'percentage': [20.0, 60.0, 20.0],
    }, index=[0, 1, 2])
    actual_result = summarise_categorical(test_input, "country")

    pdt.assert_frame_equal(actual_result, expected_result)
```
:::
:::

::: challenge
### Exercise 3 - Invalid inputs

Now write a test to check that the `summarise_categorical` function
raises an appropriate error when asked to tabulate a column that does
not exist in the data frame.

Hint: lookup `pytest.raises` in the pytest documentation.

::: solution
``` python

def test_summarise_categorical_invalid():
    """
    Test that summarise_categorical raises an
    error when a non-existent column is input
    """
    test_input = pd.DataFrame({
        'country': ['USA', 'USA', 'USA', "Russia", "Russia"],
    }, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        summarise_categorical(test_input, "vehicle")
```

Finally lets commit our test suite to our codebase and push the changes
to GitHub.

``` bash
git add eva_data_analysis.py 
git commit -m "Add additional analysis functions"
git add tests/
git commit -m "Add test suite"
git push origin main
```

### Commit and push your changes

Do not forget to commit any uncommited changes you may have and then push your work to GitHub.

```bash
git add <your_changed_files>
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

## Continuous Integration (Optional)

### Continuous Integration

So far, we have run our tests locally using.

``` bash
python -m pytest
```

A limitation of this approach is that we must remember to run our tests
each time we make any changes.

Continuous integration services provide the infrastructure to
automatically run a\
code's test suite every time changes are pushed to a remote repository.

This means that each time we (or our colleagues) push to the remote, the
test suite will be run to verify that our tests still pass.

If we are using GitHub, we can use the continuous integration service
GitHub Actions to automatically run our tests.

To setup this up:

-   Navigate to the spacewalks folder:

``` bash
cd ~/Desktop/Spacewalks
```

-   To setup continuous integration on GitHub actions, the dependencies
    of our code must be recorded in a `requirements.txt` file in the
    root of our repository.
-   You can find out more about creating requirements.txt files from
    CodeRefinery's tutorial on "Recording Dependencies".
-   For now, add the following list of code dependencies to
    requirements.txt in the root of the spacewalks repository:

``` bash
touch requirements.txt
```

Content of `requirements.txt`:

``` output
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
pytest
pytest-cov
```

-   Commit the changes to your repository:

``` bash
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requirements.txt file"
```

Now let's define out continuous integration workflow:

-   Create a hidden folder .github/workflows

``` bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/main.yml
```

-   Define the continuous integration workflow to run on GitHub actions.

``` yaml
name: CI

# We can specify which Github events will trigger a CI build
on: push

# now define a single job 'build' (but could define more)
jobs:

  build:

    # we can also specify the OS to run tests on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # a job is a sequence of steps
    steps:

    # Next we need to checkout out repository, and set up Python
    # A 'name' is just an optional label shown in the log - helpful to clarify progress - and can be anything
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python 3.12
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: "3.12"

    - name: Install Python dependencies
      run: |
        python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Test with PyTest
      run: |
        python3 -m pytest --cov
```

This workflow definition file instructs GitHub Actions to run our unit
tests using python version 3.12 each time code is pushed to our
repository,

-   Let's push these changes to our repository and see if the tests are
    run on GitHub.

``` bash
git add .github/workflows/main.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub actions workflow"
git push origin main
```

-   To find out if the workflow has run, navigate to the following page
    in your browser:

```         
https://github.com/YOUR-REPOSITORY/actions
```

-   On the left of this page a sidebar titled "Actions" lists all the
    workflows that are active in our repository. You should "CI" here
    (the `name` of the workflow we just added to our repository ).
-   The body of the page lists the outcome of all historic workflow
    runs. If the workflow was triggered successfully when we pushed to
    the repository, you should see one workflow run listed here.

### Summary

During this episode, we have covered how to use software tests to verify
the correctness of our code. We have seen how to write a unit test, how
to manage and run our tests using the pytest framework and how identify
which parts of our code require additional testing using test coverage
reports.

These skills reduce the probability that there will be a "mistake in our
code" and support reproducible research by giving us the confidence to
engage in open research practices. Tests also document the intended
behaviour of our code for other developers and mean that we can
experiment with changes to our code knowing that our tests will let us
know if we break any existing functionality. In other words, software
testing suppors FAIR software by making our code more Accessible and
Reusable.

1.  Code testing supports the FAIR principles by improving the
    accessibility and re-usability of research code.
2.  Unit testing is crucial as it ensures each functions works
    correctly.
3.  Using the `pytest` framework, you can write basic unit tests for
    Python functions to verify their correctness.
4.  Identifying and handling edge cases in unit tests is essential to
    ensure your code performs correctly under a variety of conditions.
5.  Test coverage can help you to identify parts of your code that
    require additional testing.
