:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Automating your analysis with shell scripts allows you to save and reproduce your methods.
- Version control helps you back up your work, see how data and code change over time and identify which analysis used which data and code.
- Programming languages each have advantages and disadvantages in different situations. Use the correct tools for your own work.
- Integrated development environments (IDEs) automate many coding tasks, provide easy access to documentation, and can identify common errors.
- Testing helps you check that your code is behaving as expected and will continue to do so in the future or when used by someone else.
