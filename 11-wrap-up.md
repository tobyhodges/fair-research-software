:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

-  What are the wider **Research Software Development Principles** and where does FAIR fit into them?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Reflect on the **Research Software Development Principles** and their relevance to own research.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this course we have explored the significance of reproducible research and how following the FAIR principles in 
our own work can help us and others do *better research*. 
Reproducible research often requires that researchers implement new practices and learn new tools - in this course 
we taught you some of these as a starting point but you will discover what works best for yourself, 
your group, community and domain. 
Some of these practices may take a while to implement and may require perseverance, 
others you can start practicing today.

## Research software development principles

Software and people who develop it have significance within the research environment and
a broader impact on society and the planet.
FAIR research software principles cover some aspects and operate within the wider [**Research Software Development
Principles**](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/about/research-software-development-principles/) - recommended by Software Sustainability Institute's Director Neil Chue Hong during his [keynote at RSECon23](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/about/research-software-development-principles/#neil-chue-hong-rse23-keynote).
These principles can help us explore and reflect on our own work and guide us on a path to better research.
