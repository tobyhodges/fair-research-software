<hr class="half-width"><p>Copyright allows a creator to state that they own the work
(e.g. written text, photographs, films, music, software code) they have
created. This declaration is optional - even if the creator does not
explicitly assert it, copyright of the work exists from the moment of
creation. A licence is a legal document which sets down the terms under
which the creator is releasing what they have created for others to use,
modify, extend or exploit.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-for-software">What does it mean for software?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-does-it-mean-for-software"></a></h3>
<p>Because any creative work is copyrighted the moment it is created,
even without any kind of copyright statement, registration or license
agreement, it is important to state the terms under which software can
be reused. The lack of a licence implies that no one can use the
software at all.</p>
<p>A common way to declare your copyright of a piece of software and the
license you are distributing it under is to include a file called
LICENSE in your code repository, to display it in comments at the top of
a code file or to display it on screen when the program is run. At the
very least each source file should state what license the code is under
and tell the reader to refer to the LICENSE file. This means that if the
code ever gets (accidentally) redistributed without the license file
then the reader will still know about the license that was used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="free-software">Free software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#free-software"></a></h3>
<p>In the early history of computing there were often informal
agreements where programmers would share source code with each other,
but this was rarely backed up with any formal copyright license. As the
field grew this was first formalised in the 1980s by Richard Stallman
who formed the Free Software Foundation and defined “free software” as
software which which respects users freedoms by granting them
<strong>four freedoms</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
neighbor.</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition
for this.</li>
</ol><p>The term “free” in English often causes some confusion here as it can
mean both “free as in freedom” and “free as in beer” (no charge). The
term “libre” software is sometimes used instead of “free” to help
clarify this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="open-source-software">Open source software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#open-source-software"></a></h3>
<p>In the 1990s the “open source” movement wanted to make a more
business friendly term and thought using the term “free” might lead to
confusion when people wanted to charge for software. Despite “free
software” often being given away for no charge (or just a small
charge/suggested donation to cover media or distribution costs), nothing
in the four freedoms and the software licenses that were designed around
it prohibits charging for software.</p>
<p>In 1998 the “open source definition” was created and says that
software which is open source must be distributed under the a license
which allows the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Free redistribution must be allowed</li>
<li>Source code must be included</li>
<li>Derived works must be allowed</li>
<li>Integrity of the author’s source code - there can only be
restrictions on the distribution of modifications if patches can be
distributed instead. Must explicitly permit distribution of software
built from modified source code. The license may require derived works
to carry a different name or version number from the original
software.</li>
<li>No discrimination against persons or groups</li>
<li>No discrimination against fields of endeavor</li>
<li>Distribution of license - license applies to anyone the software is
distributed to</li>
<li>License must not be specific to a product - the program can be
extracted from other software it is distributed with</li>
<li>License must not restrict other Software, e.g. cannot insist it is
only distributed alongside other open source software.</li>
<li>License must be technology-neutral</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="free-and-open-source-software-foss">Free and open source software (FOSS)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#free-and-open-source-software-foss"></a></h3>
<p>Because of these two terms many people use the term “free and open
source software” (FOSS), while others simple say “open source software”
and some will say “free software”. In reality these all have very
similar meanings that will respect the four freedoms and the open source
definition. For the rest of this chapter we will refer to “open source”,
but could have equally said “Free and Open Source Software” or “free
software”.</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="types-of-software-licenses">Types of software licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-software-licenses"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>What licence to choose for your research software depends on the
licence of other people’s software you are including in your work
(dependencies of your software) and also how you want this new combined
work to be available to others. In addition, it might be governed by
your employer policy or funders’ mandates - your employer is likely to
own all intellectual property over the work you produce while in
employment and may influence the type of the licence you should use.</p>
<p>There are a number of licences that conform to the <strong>four
freedoms</strong> and/or the <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source" class="external-link">open source
definition</a>. Here are the most commonly used ones that will likely
satisfy your needs.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="public-domain">Public domain<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#public-domain"></a></h3>
<p>While not strictly a licence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" class="external-link">public domain</a> is
a concept that enables you to waive all your interests that may exist in
your work and declare your work not protected by copyright. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" class="external-link">public domain</a>
consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual
property rights apply. Because no one holds the exclusive rights, anyone
can legally use or reference those works without permission. Note that
not having a licence is not the same as releasing your work into the
public domain - the former means no one can reuse your work whereas the
latter means everyone can. For software, this may mean using an <a href="https://unlicense.org/" class="external-link">unlicence</a> - a template for dedicating
your software to the public domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="permissive-licences">Permissive licences<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#permissive-licences"></a></h3>
<p>Permissive licences impose minimal restrictions on the use and
redistribution of covered software. Broadly speaking, these licences
require anyone redistributing the code to only include the licence text
and a copyright statement crediting the authors. This allows software
released under these licences to also be made into part of closed source
programs.</p>
<p>The most commonly used and popular choices of permissive licences
include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License" class="external-link">MIT
licence</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses" class="external-link">BSD licences</a>
(there are a few variants) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License#Apache_License_2.0" class="external-link">Apache
2.0 licence</a>.</p>
<p>The MIT and BSD licences are very simple and generally state that
anybody receiving the software can copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software to anybody
they like. The Apache 2.0 licence is similar, but in addition includes
clauses about patent licensing which require any contributor to a
program which is licensed under Apache 2.0 to allow their patents to be
used free of charge by any user of the software.</p>
<!--
The MIT license is a very simple and popular choice of license stating that:

- Anybody receiving the software can copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software to anybody they like.
- They must include the license text and copyright statement when they redistribute it.
- There is no warranty included and you cannot hold the authors liable for any problems or damages that might arise.

The BSD license is very similar to the MIT license and has several variants. The oldest is the 4-clause version which requires:

- Source code redistributions must include the copyright statement and license text.
- Binary redistributions must include the copyright notice and license text in their documentation.
- Any advertising for the software incorporating this software must include a statement saying that it includes software written by the author.
- That the author does not endorse any derived products.
- That the author does nor provide a warranty (this is written in a separate section and is not one of the 4 clauses).

The acknowledgement/advertising clause caused some controversy and some people thought that it did not meet the open
source definition or comply with the four freedoms.
It also became impractical and lead to very long statements where there were multiple authors of large pieces of software.

To address this a new version of the license known as the 3-clause BSD license was created which removed
the acknowledgement clause. An even simpler 2-clause version also exists that removes the endorsement clause.

The Apache 2.0 license is similar to the MIT and BSD licenses, but in addition includes some clauses about patent licensing.
These require any contributor to a program which is licensed under Apache 2.0 to allow their patents to be used free
of charge by any user of the software.
This was done to head off some concerns about software patent legislation at the time the license was developed.

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="copyleft-licences">Copyleft licences<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyleft-licences"></a></h3>
<p>Copyleft licences are a family of open source licences that require
any modifications, copies or redistributions of the original work be
released under a compatible copyleft licence. This can cause
complications when combining code that is under copyleft with other
licences as now the entire new codebase must be released under the
copyleft licence. If there are any incompatible terms in the other
licence used then this can prevent the two codebases from being
combined.</p>
<p>The main advantage of copyleft licences is that anyone who
incorporates the code into another product must also keep that product
open and this makes it harder for it to be subsumed into a commercial
product that does not contribute improvements to the code back to the
community which created it.</p>
<p>The most commonly known copyleft licence is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" class="external-link">GNU
Public License or GPL</a> (has several versions and used by a lot of
popular software including the Linux kernel). Compared with the
permissive licences, GPL is quite a long licence agreement and many of
its clauses can be quite difficult for non-lawyers to fully
understand.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License" class="external-link">GNU
Lesser General Public License</a> (LGPL) - a special version of GPL -
allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software
component released under the open source LGPL into their own (even
proprietary) software without being required by the terms of a strong
copyleft licence to release the source code of their own components
(which is the requirement of GPL). GPL requires that all its derivative
works be licensed as a whole under the terms of the GPL. If an
application links to a library licensed under GPL, it must also be
licensed under GPL and the source code of the application must be
provided. By contrast, libraries licensed under the LGPL may be linked
to proprietary applications. If linked statically, the application code
must also be released as LGPL, or everything that allows the user to
re-link the application with a different version of the LGPL source code
must be provided. As long as the application is linked dynamically to
LGPL software, the proprietary code can be kept proprietary.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License" class="external-link">GNU
Affero General Public License</a> (AGPL) is designed to address the
issue for GPL software running on remote web servers - users are not
receiving copies of such software on their machines but are interacting
with them over computer networks and hence the person running the web
server has no obligation to supply users with the source code. The AGPL
requires that people running web applications licensed under the AGPL
need to make the source code of such applications available to their
users.</p>

<h3 id="creative-commons-licences">Creative Commons licences<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creative-commons-licences"></a></h3>
<p>All of the licences we have discussed so far are really only intended
for source code. They are not suitable for documentation, datasets,
drawings, logos, music, maps, etc. - which you may want to include as
part of your software project. To solve this problem there are the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/" class="external-link">Creative
Commons (CC) licences,</a> which are expressly built for anything other
than source code.</p>
<p>The CC licences grant the following baseline rights:</p>
<ul><li>Attribution (BY) - all the Creative Commons licences require you to
give credit to the original creator (so all will have the BY component).
This is very similar to what is required by all of the permissive code
licences.</li>
<li>Share-Alike (SA) - requires any derivative works to be released
under a compatible creative commons licence. This is very similar to the
way that copyleft licences work.</li>
<li>Non-Commercial (NC) - only allow for non-commercial use of the
work.</li>
<li>No Derivatives (ND) - users of the work cannot redistribute modified
versions of it.</li>
</ul><p>Combinations of various rights that are granted give us the following
six Creative Commons licences:</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" class="external-link">CC BY</a> -

</ul><p>In addition to the licences above, Creative Commons also offers <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" class="external-link">CC0</a> - a
public dedication tool, which enables creators to give up their

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="choosing-a-licence">Choosing a licence<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-a-licence"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>When choosing a license for your code there is a number of things you
might want to consider:</p>
<ul><li>Are you reusing code which is already under an open source licence?
What obligations do you have under those licences?</li>
<li>Do you want to ensure that anybody modifying and redistributing your
code will release the source code of their changes?</li>
<li>Do you want to ensure the least number of restrictions and that your
code will be used as widely as possible? Even if that means it might end
up in commercial products that do not release their source code and do
not compensate you.</li>
<li>Is there a preferred license used in your research community?</li>
<li>Do not be tempted to write your own licence (or modify an existing
one) unless you are a copyright lawyer. The common open source licenses
have been carefully written by copyright lawyers, many of them have
undergone multiple iterations in response to cases that have arisen and
the implications of many different legal jurisdictions have been
considered. The common licenses are also well known, meaning that
potential users and contributors have a better understanding of what
their rights and responsibilities are leaving less room for
misunderstanding.</li>
<li>Remember that the rights granted in a licence cannot be revoked once
it has been applied.</li>

Creative Commons licenses, which are expressly built for anything other
than source code. Creative commons has now gone through four versions
with the latest being version 4.0, generally you should use version 4.0

<p>You have created a library of functions that are commonly used by
researchers in your field. You would like to share this code with your
research community and ensure that the code remains as open as possible
to benefit the community. But you would also like to see it being
integrated into as many different research codes and even commercial
products as possible. What would be a good choice of license?</p>

<p>The LGPL license could be a good choice for library code. It can be
linked to software that is not GPL licensed but any modifications to the
library itself must be released under a GPL compatible license.</p>

<h3 id="license-compatibility">License compatibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#license-compatibility"></a></h3>
<p>Generally, you can relicense someone else’s code under more
permissive licenses to less permissive ones without their permission.
For example, you could relicense code from the MIT license to the GPL.
This is because nothing in the GPL contradicts anything in the MIT
license, but you will still have to display the MIT license for the
original code and the GPL for your modifications.</p>
<p>This does not work the other way though, you cannot take code
released under GPL and relicense it as MIT since MIT is a more liberal
license that does not match the terms of the GPL.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Zero (CC0) or public domain code can usually be
relicensed to any open source license (or a commercial license for that
matter).</p>
<p>Sometimes there are contradictory statements in licenses which
prevent relicensing. For example, the Apache 2.0 license has some
provisions about software patents, you will not be able to relicense the
Apache 2.0 code under the MIT license since the latter does not have an
equivalent patent clause.</p>
<p>The GNU project has a [useful guide on license
compatibility][gnu-license-guide].</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="getting-agreement-to-relicense">Getting agreement to relicense<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#getting-agreement-to-relicense"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes the developers of a program will wish to change the license
it is distributed under. In order to do this they’ll need the agreement
of all the copyright holders of the program and typically this will mean
everyone who contributed code to it. This is fine if you only have a
handful of contributors to your project, but gets harder when the
project starts to grow bigger.</p>
<p>Some projects work around this by having contributors agree to a
“contributor license agreement”. This will set out the terms under which
the code is contributed to the project. It might include a copyright
assignment or just granting certain rights to the project. This usually
allows the company (or non-profit foundation as many open source
projects are based on non-profit foundations) running the project to
relicense the code in future and to take legal action against people who
violate the license.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="going-commercial">Going commercial<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#going-commercial"></a></h3>
<p>It is possible to sell software that is licensed under an open source
license commercially, you will need to supply the source code along with
the binaries. However, under any license meeting the Open Source
Definition or the Four Freedoms the person receiving the software can
make copies and give (or sell) them to anybody else.</p>
<p>It is also possible to release software under two licenses, one open
source and one commercial. This has been done by a few open source
projects who wish to sell the software to some customers (sometimes with
extra custom modifications) and give it to others.</p>
