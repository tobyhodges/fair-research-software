# Tools and Practices for FAIR Research Software Course

This short course is teaching tools and practices for producing and sharing quality, 
sustainable and [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research software](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x)
to support open and reproducible research. 
The course can be delivered over 2 full or 4 half days.

The course is visible at: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-research-software/ and uses [the Markdown lesson template][workbench-markdown-template] from the [The Carpentries Workbench lesson infrastructure][sandpaper-documentation].

The course uses the [software repository with code that does not follow FAIR research software practices](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronaut-data-analysis-not-so-good) 
and gradually improves it over the course of the lesson. Finally, the improved code that the course finishes with is in the [astronaut-data-analysis-fair repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronaut-data-analysis-fair).

The accompanying [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KahaD7EGxJWXaCDKWAG6Wva4a9zo9Lp-qFyyofgM0vw/edit?usp=sharing) to aid with course delivery are also available.
